# Profile 
My name is Kevin and I'm a second year MURP student in the Design and Development concentration. I was born in the Philippines but grew up in Los Angeles. I've worked primarily in education before the MURP program through Teach For America and the JET Program, but got to work in tourism development while living in Japan. I'm interested in park access within the context of health and inclusive urban design. I enjoy traveling and love outdoor activities too. Really excited to learn GIS with everyone.
# Course Description 
We are using Python command coding language to blend together different statistic data with spatial data to create some insightful maps. The course, to my understanding, is meant to enhance our critical analysis and understanding of spatial data.
# Project Ideas
I'd be interested in looking at park access for different ethnic groups in Los Angeles, maybe Southeast Asian groups who experience higher rates of cardiovascular disease. I'm still thinking through other ideas but I'd also be interested in urban displacement issues in Manila. 
- Park access and Prevalence of Cardiovascular Disease 
- Manila Urban Displacement 
- Inclusive Design 
# Course Objectives 
I want to improve on visual data presentation and overall gain new technical skills. 

# Datasets 
Usable GIS Data About the Philippines
https://gist.github.com/mapmakerdavid/71f6fa6c6ebf6055c4336926daac5290#file-usable-gis-data-philippines-csv
<sub> This file contains important spatial data regarding the capital city of Manila that pertain to geography and topography. </sub> 

LANAView Data

<sub> I'd also be interested to see park access for low income residents and communities in Los Angeles. </sub> 

# Thinking Cap 
https://www.urbandisplacement.org/maps/manila-gentrification-and-displacement/
<sub> This data set provides different layers to consider when people are displaced. Manila is currently experiencing an infrastructure boom and many low income residents are further pushed to the city's peripheries. It highlights the biggest threat of displacement in different areas of the city.
