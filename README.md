# Profile 
My name is Kevin and I'm a second year MURP student in the Design and Development concentration. I was born in the Philippines but grew up in Los Angeles. I've worked primarily in education before the MURP program through Teach For America and the JET Program, but got to work in tourism development while living in Japan. I'm interested in park access within the context of health and inclusive urban design. I enjoy traveling and love outdoor activities too. Really excited to learn GIS with everyone.
# Course Description 
We are using Python command coding language to blend together different statistic data with spatial data to create some insightful maps. The course, to my understanding, is meant to enhance our critical analysis and understanding of spatial data.
# Project Ideas
I'd be interested in looking at park access for different ethnic groups in Los Angeles, maybe Southeast Asian groups who experience higher rates of cardiovascular disease. I'm still thinking through other ideas but I'd also be interested in urban displacement issues in Manila. 
- Park access and Prevalence of Cardiovascular Disease 
- Manila Urban Displacement 
- Inclusive Design 
# Course Objectives 
I want to improve on visual data presentation and overall gain new technical skills.
